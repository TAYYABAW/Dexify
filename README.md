## 💬 Amazon Clone using React.js

This project is a Full-stack fully functional Amazon clone application using JavaScript, React.js, Material-UI, and some Firebase services like Firebase hosting and Cloud Database.

## 📝 What I have done in this project

- Build it by [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Created different `components` for different functionalities like `orderScreen`, `CheckoutScreen`, `header`, `orderHistory` and more..
- Used [`react-router-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to navigate among various paths of the application
- Build clean **mobile friendly** user interface using [`material-ui`](https://material-ui.com/)
- Used [`Cloud Firestore`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store all `Orders` in realtime database
- Deployed it with [`Firebase Hosting`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
